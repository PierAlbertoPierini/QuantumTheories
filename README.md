# Quantum computing errors for Earthquake preventions
We know that Qubit are noisy when using them in computation but the noisy are only pasage of energy from the environment and the environment is not in himself noisy if we can read on them with a clear vision.
Observing the noisy from the Qubit and find for each one the frequency of each of them we can separate and find the frequency of a preparing earthquake and a real earthquake in progres.

# Human state life mirroring on the Quantum state and Environment behave
